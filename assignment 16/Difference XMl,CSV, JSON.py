# Using Python's built-in CSV function, CSV files can be read and written to.
# Typically, data is read into a list of lists.

# JSON provides a clean, easy-to-read format because it maintains a dictionary-style structure.
# Just like CSV, Python also has a built-in module for JSON, which makes reading and writing in this format incredibly easy.

# Working with data in XML format is slightly different from CSV and JSON data types.
# In general, CSV and JSON are widely used due to their simplicity.
# It is easy for humans to write, read and interpret both types of expressed files.
# In order to work with these two data formats, there is no need to do anything else (except what is stated).
# Parsing a JSON or CSV file is very simple. But working with XML files is a bit more difficult.
